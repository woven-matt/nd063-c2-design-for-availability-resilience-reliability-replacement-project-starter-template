RTO

Single AZ - 1–2 Minutes:
Cluster provides redundancy for single AZ outage.
Single Region - 45m ~ 1hr
Respond to incident: 15m
Determine problem: 15m
Fail over instance by promoting read replica: 15m

RPO
Single AZ - 0:
Cluster provides redundancy for single AZ outage.
Single Region - 6–20 Minutes
AWS documentation suggests this RPO should be 6-20 minutes.  But in practice this is probably lower, as the read cluster should be reading the log and updating regularly, so this should be minutes in practice.
